## Advanced metadata
The advanced metadata sections are meant for advanced users of the ROHUB. Here the users can find all the annotations created so far in the RO, moreover advanced users can create new annotations and assign semantic properties to the annotations. There are two separate boxes for the users to create semantic property and value. By clicking the “Add” the ROHUB platform creates a new annotation with the assigned semantic property and the value provided by the user. The newly created annotation will be then visible in the list of annotations of the RO. The user can inspect each of the listed annotations and see the metadata by clicking on them or expanding them. Each annotation opens up with a new window showing the information like the annotation id, creation date and time of the annotation, creator’s information and the semantic relation it represents (subject, property and object). The user can download the annotation (in rdf format) and also can delete the annotation from this new window.
