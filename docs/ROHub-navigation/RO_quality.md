Presently this section is still to integrate in the ROHub portal. This section of the RO will enable users to assess the quality of a research object according to some predefined quality criteria (e.g. completeness). This section interacts with the quality checklist service to showcase the desired results. Additionally, this section enables the RO monitoring tool to assess the RO quality history. On full integration this section will have two segments as described below.

## RO completeness segment


## Quality checked List
