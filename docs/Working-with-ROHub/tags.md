This segment of the RO create/edit wizard allows the user to add additional metadata to the RO such as:

### Keywords
In order to add a keyword to the RO, the user clicks inside the box under the “Keywords” saying “Type to add” a list of existing keywords drops down. The user can select one or multiple keywords from the list. In case of new keywords which in any case are not present in the existing list of keywords, a create option appears once the user types in the new keyword allowing the user to create a new keyword. The user can create multiple new keywords and later add them to the RO from the list. The user can also remove any of the keywords from this box.

### Main Entity
The user can select the main entity of the RO (e.g.CLI, dataset, document etc.) from a list of existing entities. Once the user clicks the box under the "Main Entity" a list of the existing entities available in the ROHUB portal drops down for the user to choose a suitable entity.

### Golden
If the user wants to make the RO appear as a golden example in the homepage of the ROHUB portal, the checkbox saying "Golden" needs to be selected. Upon creation or modification the RO will appear in the golden example section in the main ROHUB homepage. If the user wishes to make the RO not appear a golden example he can unselect the "Golden" option and the RO will no longer appear in the ROHUB homepage.
