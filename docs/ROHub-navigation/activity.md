The activity page  can be accessed from the topmost menubar of the ROHUb portal. This section comprises the two sections:
# Global Activity List
The global activity list is the one that summarises and presents all activities conducted by all users on all research objects available in ROHub. This list comprises mainly of the Date and time of the performed activity, activity event describing the type of activity (e.g. creation of a RO, addition of resources, addition of annotations etc.) and the name of the ROHub User who performed the activity (link of the user profile page). Additionally in case of activities involving annotations the user can download the annotation simply by clicking on the icon “Annotations”.
