The ROHub users can access a research object either by the keyword search or from the "Explore" section. From the list of ROs in the explore page the user can access any specific RO and its subsequent metadata on clicking “Read more” on the right hand side of the adjacent RO. The metadata of a specific research object in the ROHub platform can be categorised in various subsections as described below.
