## Integration with EGI Notebooks
ROHub integrates EGI Notebooks service, enabling users to open and execute their Jupyter Notebooks in  EGI  Notebooks directly  from  ROHub portal.  In  order  to  use  this  functionality the user needs to have an account with access to [EGI Notebooks service](https://notebooks.egi.eu/) and the user needs also to have an account and be logged in ROHub and the resource to be reproduced must have type “Jupyter Notebook”. When the user clicks on such resource in ROHub portal, independently if it’s an internal or  external  resource,  the user  can  choose  to  go  to  the  resource  itself  (download  the  notebook)  or  to open it  in  EGI  Notebook,  as  depicted  in  the  figure below. If  the  user  opens  the  resource  in  EGI  Notebook, the service will be launched and the user will be able to execute itas depicted in the below.
