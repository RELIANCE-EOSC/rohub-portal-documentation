The overview subsection of the Research Object displays the essential information/metadata of the RO. The overview divides the metadata of a research object into various readable segments. These segments are described in the below mentioned sections.

## Main RO Overview metadata segments
* At the top has a segment that includes the title of the RO, description, research areas, research object type, access mode, status,  creation date and time, last modification date and time, last activity date and time, creator’s identity and the relevant sketch associated with the research object.
* In some especially relevant ROs the metadata elements might include geospatial information associated with the RO that can be displayed in a map popup window. The segment for geolocation displays the geographic information as the user clicks the “Location” segment.  In this case the annotations for the geolocation are added automatically by the semantic enrichment service.
* The overview page also shows a summary of the contents encapsulated within the research object inspite of having a separate section for contents in the research object. The "Content" subsection within the overview page shows the aggregated resources/contents of the RO and enables the user to browse through them.
* Within the overview page the "Activity" segment summarizes the most recent activity done on the research object. The user will be transferred to the main activity section to see all the available activities of the research object on clicking the “View all” option.
* The overview also contains the "Lifecycle chart" segment where the most recent evolution of the research object is summarized for the user with information of the user and date and time of the activity. From this subsection the user can navigate to the main lifecycle section of the research object to see all the overall evolution of the RO on clicking “View all”.
* The "Similar ROs" subsection looks for similar ROs and lists them in this part.
* The overview also contains the annotations added automatically to the research object by the semantic enrichment service. Selecting “Show All Annotations” at the end of the overview panel, drops down and displays all the annotations added to the research object. Each annotation pops out in a separate window on clicking one of the annotations listed within the list. The user can also hide the annotation list on clicking the “Hide Annotations”.

## Toolbars and Summary Segments
On the right side of the overview page contains the various summary segments and toolbars such as:
   * Summary segment of the RO including rating, comment, likes, the number of views and downloads. Additional quantitative metadata such as the number of resources, annotations, activity events, forks, snapshots/archives, as well as the research object size can be displayed on clicking “See more details” present in this segment.
   * “AGENTS” segment holds the name of the creator and the importer associated with the Research Object. The user can click on the name of the creator and navigate to the user profile from this segment.
   * "COMPLETENESS" shows the status of the quality of the RO in regard to its percentage of completeness. This is a status bar which shows the percentage of the RO quality.
   * “DISCOVERED METADATA” segment holds the relevant metadata/keywords suitable with the RO for the purpose of better keyword-based search of the ROs. There is a legend having different colors for denoting keywords relating to “Persons”, “Domains”, “Frequent Expressions”, “Places”, “Organizations” and “Concepts”.
   * “TOOLBOX” segment allowing the user to download the research object, or its metadata; to get the research object atom feed that can be used to subscribe to the research object notifications; manage the research object evolution if the user is allowed (e.g., to create snapshots, archives, or fork the research object); manage the research object annotations if the user is allowed (e.g., to update the annotations from the semantic enrichment service, import an annotation body, or display the advanced annotation view
   * “SHARE” allows the user to share the RO over social media e.g. Twitter, Facebook etc (still under integration) or by directly creating and copying shareable link.
   * “CITE AS” segment shows the citations used in the RO (if any)
   * “LICENSE” segment shows the associated license of the RO (if any). The user can view the license by directly clicking on it. On clicking the user will be redirected to the webpage describing the license.
   * "COPYRIGHT HOLDER" segment holds the links to the contact pages of the organizations who holds the copyright of the Research Objects. The clickable link will redirect the user to directly access more information of the funding body/organization from its official webpage.
   * At the very end of the overview page lies the comment section where the user can provide their comments and post them.
