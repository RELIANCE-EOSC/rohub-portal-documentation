The “Content” section shows the aggregated resources in a research object where the user is enabled to browse and navigate through the resources. The resources can also include folders and subfolders. When the user selects a resource, its metadata information is displayed at the end of the page along with the annotations added in the ROHub platform for that particular resource. From the Content page the user can also create new resources and add them to the RO. The segments of the content page can be described as below:

The main section lists the RO contents in a tabular format with the name of the content, details (e.g. denoting number of entries in a folder), creation time and date and creator’s name.
From this page the user can also add additional resources to the RO.
The home page of the content section also has a drag and drop segment for directly adding resources to the RO.  
The figures below show the above described functionalities of the RO Content page
