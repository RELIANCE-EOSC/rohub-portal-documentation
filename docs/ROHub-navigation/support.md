## Support
The support page can be accessed from the top menu bar as well as from the bottom of the ROhub landing page. In the support section the user can find the ROHub documentation and a brief summary of how to browse the research objects present in the platform. There will also be a frequently asked question section which is still under construction. The documentation of the ROHub is still to be updated and on completion the users can download it in pdf form from the support section. The figure below shows the support section of the ROHub platform.
