## ADAM platform

The ADAM platform exposes EO Data  Cubes collections and products which can be described and aggregated   in   the Research Object. The ADAM platform has been integrated in the ROHub so that collections/products can be easily aggregated in RO from ROHub portal. During the process of aggregation the collection/product metadata from ADAM is added automatically as annotations of the resource created inside the RO using the RELIANCE RO-crate profile and vocabulary. 
In the ROHub portal, in the edition mode of the resources section the user can click on the add data cube resource  icon, and in  the  dialog  box that  appears, the user can  select  from  the  dropdown list  (or using  autocomplete)  the  data  cube  collection and  optionally  the  data  cube  product  (inside  that collection),  and  then  add  optionally  other  basic  metadata  (title,  description,  license,  keywords),  as depicted in the figure below.

Data cubes collection/products  aggregated  in  the  Research Object  can  be  opened directly in  ADAM 
platform to  visualise  them  on  the  3D  globe.  When  a  user  clicks  on  a  data  cube  collection  from 
ROHub,  it  will  be  opened  in  ADAM.  And  when  the  user  clicks  on  a  data  cube  product,   the user  can 
choose  to  go  to  the  physical  resource  (download  the  geoTiff  file  by  default),  or  open  it  in  ADAM 
platform, as depicted in the figure
