## Create Research Object
Once the user is logged in to the ROHUB platform he is ready to create his own research objects. In order to create a new research object the user has to fill a wizard consisting of various information vital to creation of a RO. First from the landing page of the portal the user needs to click “My ROS”, a new page opens where the user can his previously created ROs and the editable ROs he has permission to in two sections named “My RO” and “Editable RO” respectively. If the user doesn't have any previously created ROs then the page will display “There are no Research objects created by You yet.”
