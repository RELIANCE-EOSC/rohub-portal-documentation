The “Content” section shows the aggregated resources in a research object where the user is enabled to browse and navigate through the resources. The resources can also include folders and subfolders. When the user selects a resource, its metadata information (e.g. name, description, creation date and time, modification date and time, creators’ name) is displayed at the end of the page along with the annotations added in the ROHub platform for that particular resource. From the Content page the user can also create new resources or edit/modify resources and aggregate them to the RO. The segments of the content page can be described as below:



* The navigation section lists the RO contents that shows  metadata like the size or number of resources in a folder, creation time and date, creator identity etc. This page also allows the user to add resources manually or either uploading the resources by directly draging and droping in the webpage or choosing files locally from the user's desktop. The user can create a folder within a parent folder, add resouces from external links or can upload them directly in the portal from this section.
* The resource details section, which appears after the user selects (or clicks on) a resource in the navigation panel. It shows basic resource metadata e.g. title, resource type, number of contents in case of folder, URI (in case of a single resource element), creation date, modification date, author etc. Moreover on selecting a resource the content section shows actions on these resources from where the user is allowed certain actions like moving the content across various folders, edition, deletion etc.
* On selecting a single resource the user is allowed to see the available annotation list associated with the resource.  On clicking the “Show Annotations” the user can see the annotations associated with that particular resource selected by the user.
