Once the user creates a Research Object with the basic information the newly created RO can be accessed from the Explore page of the ROHub or from the "My RO" sections. The user can continue to add additional metadata during the creation process or edit the RO later by clicking the edit option (saying "Edit this RO" on hovering) from the RO toolbox present on the left hand side of the RO Overview page. The figure below shows the edit option in the toolbox of a RO overview.

On clicking "Edit this RO" from the RO overview page a new page opens called the "Research Object Editing" page containing the various segments of RO creation/editing wizard. The wizard is the same in both creation and editing except in case of RO editing some segments can already hold metadata. The RO creation/editing wizard is the same as mentioned in the previous segment and has the following segments.
* Basic Information:  The fields in this page always have data as this is the basic part of a RO, the user can change the title, description, access mode , owner's name, editor's name, research areas, RO type etc. The user has options to “Update & Exit”, “Reset form” , “Update & Continue” or “Skip”.
* People & organizations:  From this segment the user can change the name of people and organization and their roles associated in the RO. Also the user can add new people and organizations and assign roles to them. On completion the user can click “Update & Continue” to the next form or “Back” to the previous form. If the user has nothing to modify here he can click “Skip” and move to the next segment of the wizard.
* Tags:  The user can add or edit keywords, research communities etc. associated with an RO from this segment. The user can also either assign the RO as a golden example in the main landing page of the ROHUB portal or deselect the “Golden” option. On completion the user can click “Update & Continue” to the next form or “Back” to the previous form. If the user has nothing to modify here he can click “Skip” and move to the next segment of the wizard.
* Sketches gallery: In this segment the user can modify the sketch images. The user can either upload (internally and/or externally) new images or remove the already added images.

* Related locations:  From here the user can add or remove the locations if it's relevant for an RO. This is not a mandatory field and can be skipped or updated depending on the contents of the RO.
