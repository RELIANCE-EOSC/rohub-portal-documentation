## Resources
From the content page the user can create new resources from the  create icons present at the top of the resources list. There are three functionalities added to the ROHUb portal for creating folders and adding/uploading files as resources in the RO content.

### Create new folder
On clicking the “Create new folder” icon an new window pops up for the user. Here the user can create a new folder by typing the title, description and can also choose the parent folder from the dropped down list of the existing folders in the RO content if the user wants to enlist it in any of them.  Otherwise simply keeping this field empty will create a new folder in the home of the content section. On clicking the “Create” the user creates a new folder which will be visible in the content list of the RO. The figure below shows the creation of the folder in the RO content page.

### Create new resource from internal source
On clicking the second icon  a window pops up to “Create new resource”. The user can upload a file from his local device on clicking the “Choose file” and selecting a file/resource internally. Upon filling the “Title” and “description” fields the user has to select a “Resource type” from the list of type displayed on clicking the field of resource type to denote the type of the uploaded resource. On clicking “Create”  the resource is added in the RO content. Another way to create new resources is to add selected files directly by draggind and dropping in the upload segment saying "Drag and drop files here..." and providing the title, description and the resource type.

### Create new resource from external source
On clicking the third icon another window pops up to “Create new resource”. The user can provide the URL of an external resource in the field saying “External URL”. Upon filling the “Title” and “description” fields the user has to select a “Resource type” from the list of type displayed on clicking the field of "Resource type" to denote the type of the  resource. On clicking “Create” the resource is added in the RO content.

The user can modify or edit any resource of choice from the resource list. The resource edit, move and delete functionalities activate when the user selects any resource from the list. Moreover on selecting a resource its metadata is also displayed as mentioned in the content home section.

### Renaming a resource
In case the selected resource is a folder the user can rename it from the “Rename folder” window that pops up when the user clicks on the edit icon present in the main content page. From this window the user can rename the title and description of the folder. Similarly for renaming internal or external resources, the user has to select the particular resource and on clicking the edit mode the “Rename resource” window appears. In this window the user can update the fields relevant to the resource type. In both cases clicking “Rename” will update the resources. The following figures depicts the renaming functionality of the RO resources.

### Moving a resource
The user can move a resource from one folder to another in the portal. The user has to select a resource from the content list and then click the move icon, a window pops up displaying either “Move folder” (for moving a folder) or “Move resource” (for moving a resource) where the user can specify the “parent folder”. Once the user clicks on the field saying parent folder, a list of all the existing folders of the content appears. From the list the user can easily specify the folder where he wants to move the resource. Clicking “Move” ends the action and moves the resource from one folder to another.

### Deleting a resource
Deleting a resource is also easy. Selecting a resource and clicking the delete icon from the content page pops up the “Delete folder” or “Delete resource” window. By clicking the “Delete” button the resource could be deleted by the user. The figures below depicts the deletion of resources in ROHub portal.

### Adding annotation to a resource
Once a resource is created the annotation of the resource is also created in the content section. After selecting the resource the user can also see the added annotation associated with the resource by clicking the “Show All Annotations”. An advanced user can also create additional annotations to a resource by providing the semantic property and value in the boxes saying “Type property..” and “Type value..”. The property should be a fully qualified name (URL), otherwise the ROHub namespace will be prepended, whereas the value can be of any type (e.g. URL, text, numeric). Thereafter clicking “Add” will add the annotation with the selected resource and will be visible in the annotation list. On clicking any of the annotations from the list the user can see the annotation metadata like the annotation id, subject, property and value.

The user can continue creating/editing the metadata of the RO in the next form by clicking "Update and continue", or "Skip" to skip this part and move to the next segment or "Back" to move to the previous segment of the RO editing.
