# Evolution Wizard
Any Research Object can be forked, snapshotted or archived from the Evolution wizard. In the toolbox segment present on the right hand side of the overview page of a RO a user can find the “Evolution”. On clicking the “Evolution” the user can see the “Fork”, “Snapshot” and “Archive” options. Each of them are briefly discussed in the sections below.
