## FAIROs service

FAIROs service measures the FAIRness of Research Objects, by calculating the  FAIRness  of  individual aggregated resources,  including  the  Research  Object  itself,  and  then aggregating those results to calculate the over FAIR score.  The service has been recently deployed, and  it  is  currently  being  integrated  in  ROHub.  The  service  functionality  will  be  available  via  the ROHub  portal  and  python library  in  a  similar  way  as  the  checklist  service  functionalities,  i.e.,  in  the portal  the  overall score  will be  displayed  in  the  overview  tab  of  the  Research  Object,  and there  will be a dedicated tab to show details of the FAIRness evaluation.
