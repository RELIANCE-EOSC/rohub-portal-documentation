In the Resource segment the user can add resources, browse the uploaded resources from the list of resources in the "Home" (resources listed with name, details, creation date and time and creator's name), edit/modify the uploaded resources and view the annotations created with respect to the added resources. The various functions are discussed below.

## Creating new Resources
From the "Resource" segment of the RO create/edit wizard the user can create new resources and add them to the RO, navigate through the resources and also remove them if required. The resource creation functionalities of this segment are discussed briefly.
### Create new folder
On clicking the first of  the three black icons (representing a folder) a new window called “Create new folder” pops up for the user. The various fields in this windows are:
* Title:  In the title field the user has to provide the name of the folder. Without providing the title the user is unable to create a folder. The title must contain a minimum of five characters.
* Description:  The User can optionally provide a short description of the folder.
* Parent folder:  From this field the user can choose a parent folder if the user wants to enclose the folder within any other folders.

On clicking the “Create” the user creates a new folder which will be visible in the content list of the RO. The figure below shows the creation of the folder in the RO content page.

## Adding annotation to a resource
Once a resource is created the annotation of the resource is also created automatically in the resource segment. After selecting the resource the user can also see the added annotation associated with the resource by clicking the “Show All Annotations”. An advanced user can also create additional annotations to a resource by providing the semantic property and value in the boxes saying “Type property..” and “Type value..”. The property should be a fully qualified name (URL), otherwise the ROHub namespace will be prepended, whereas the value can be of any type (e.g. URL, text, numeric). Thereafter clicking “Add” will add the annotation with the selected resource and will be visible in the annotation list. On clicking any of the annotations from the list the user can see the annotation metadata like the annotation id, subject, property and value.
