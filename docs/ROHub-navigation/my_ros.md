This section in the ROHub platform enables an authenticated user to create a research object directly from the user interface of the portal. When a user signs into the portal and on clicking the “My ROs” from the top menu bar gets into the page where he can create new research objects from scratch, see his own created ROs as well as the ROs he is allowed to edit in the platform. The users can also delete any unwanted RO from this page. The subsections of “My ROs” are described briefly below.

## The entry page of “My RO” section
This page has the list of ROs owned by the logged in user. The “My owned research object’s list” holds all the ROs created/owned by the user and can be viewed page wise. The user on clicking to the “Read more” icon can also access these ROs in read mode. On the right hand side of this page there is “Create new RO”. On clicking this the user will be guided to the various forms used to create a RO from scratch in edit mode. The creation of ROs is described in detail in the later sections. From this page on clicking “Delete” placed under each RO in the list, the user can delete a RO if required.
