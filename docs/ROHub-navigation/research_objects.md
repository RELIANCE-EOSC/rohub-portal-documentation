# Research objects

The ROHub users can access a research object either by the keyword search or from the "Explore" section. From the list of ROs in the explore page the user can access any specific RO and its subsequent metadata on clicking “View” on the right hand side of the adjacent RO. The Reserach Objects open with basic information like the Title, date and time of the creation, creator's names, contributors' names, RO type, RO access mode and reserach areas. Additional to the basic information the metadata of a research object in the ROHub platform can be categorized in various subsections as mentioned below.
