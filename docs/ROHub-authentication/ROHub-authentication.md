## Login Section
The login (Sign in/Sign up) is available on the menu bar of the homepage. The keycloak authentication system allows the users to login either with existing EGI credentials or users can register themselves with their own login and password. Once registered the authentication system allows the registered users to sign in to the ROhub portal. The sections below briefly describe the login and sign up functionalities of the ROhub portal.

### Signing into the ROHub Account
On clicking any of the "Sign in '' or "Sign up" the user is navigated to the authentication page. From here the user can sign in either through the EGI Check-in on clicking the "Login with EGI Check-in". On clicking the user is redirected to the EGI authentication system and on completion the user gets signed into the ROHub Portal via the EGI check in process. The user can also sign in from this page with his registered credentials for ROHUb portal.

### Password Reset
The authentication page also allows the user to go for a resetting of password. Once the user clicks on the “Forgot password?”, he gets redirected to the page where the user can provide the email address and the instructions on how to create a new password will be sent as an email. After providing the email address and clicking “Submit” the user gets an email. The user can navigate back to the login page by clicking “Back to Login”.

### Registering the new User
New users can be registered into the ROhub portal from the login page. Once the new user clicks “Register” the registration form opens. In the various fields of the form the user can provide registration details (e.g. first name, last name, email, and password). The registration procedure completes on clicking the “Register” at the end of the form and “Back to Login” navigates the user back to the login page.
