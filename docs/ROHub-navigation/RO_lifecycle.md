The graphical representation of the life cycle chart on the left side of the page includes the actions like snapshots, forks and archive (release on completion) as branches on the main live branch. The lifecycle chart also shows a list of each event of the RO over the period of timeline with relevant metadata. The various segments of the lifecycle page are described below.

## Legend

## Graphical representation of Lifecycle
This segment runs on the left side of the page and shows in a graphical form all the evolutionary actions performed on the RO. Status of the ROs like forked, snapshotted or archived forms a separate git-like branch from the main to represent the evolution and also connects the lifecycle list.

## List of the lifecycle activities
This list displays the evolutionary actions or status of the RO and describes them briefly with metadata like the type of action (e.g. created, imported, forked, snapshotted etc.) performed on the RO. The metadata includes the data and time of the performance of the action and the name of the user involved. The name of the user is clickable and navigates to the user profile of the performer.
