## Integration with Zenodo and B2Share

From the ROHub portal the users  are  able  to  publish  snapshots/archives  of  Research  Objects in Zenodo and/or B2Share. From  ROHub  portal,  the  user  can  generate  a  snapshot/archive  from  the  source  Research  Object overview page using the third button called "Evolution" in the toolbox (as depicted in the figure. Selecting  any  of  the  evolution  options  (fork,  snapshot,  archive)  will  open  the  RO  creation  wizard, customized to the state selected. In the case of snapshot/archive, the wizard gives the possibility to generate a DOI or provide an existing DOI, and/or to publish it in Zenodo/B2Share as shown in the figures below.
