# Explore
The Explore page can be accessed by the user on clicking “EXPLORE” from the topmost menubar of the ROHub platform. This section enables the user to browse and navigate the research objects collection by organising them according to their semantic properties and allowing users to discover the objects by applying multiple search filters. By default the explore page lists all the available ROs, the user can sort them according to ascending/descending data of creation. The number of ROs in one page can be changed too from the explore page for the user. From the explore page the user can browse/search ROs in the following ways:

## Faceted search results view
In this view the user can search for keyword specific research objects from the keyword serah box present at the top of the explore page. This fetches the list of research objects according to the keywords used for the search. The view is made by default in list view and another option of image icon (wherever available) for each RO is available. In both cases the same information about ROs is presented. Each research object in the list contains the key metadata like title, description, RO type, research areas, creation date and time etc. as depicted in the figure below. On clicking the “read more” the user can enter into the research object with its respective sections.

## Filter search
The filter search allows the user to further filter the results of the fetched ROs according to various criteria. The figure below shows the filter section present in the left side of the explore page. On cycling the green drop-down icon the user can select the options from each filter section and also can reset all the filters from this section.

Each filter section has various options to choose so that the user can filter through the most desired results of the research object. The subsections and their figures are as follows:
### Research Areas
In the filter the user can select the from a vast range of research areas (broadly in applied sciences, earth sciences, life sciences, physical sciences and space science) available in the ROhub platform to fetch the results from those specific research areas.

### Creator
The ROHub platform allows the user to filter the research objects from the platform based on the identity of the creators. The user can provide the names of single or multiple creators (from the signed up users of ROHub) to see the results of the research objects created by them. Once the user starts to type in the search field or simply click on it the list of the existing users of the ROHub portal drops down and the user can select one or multiple users from the list. There is also possibility to delete any of the entered value by clicking the "x" icon alongside the provided value.
