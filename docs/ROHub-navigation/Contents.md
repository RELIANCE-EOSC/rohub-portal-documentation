The “Content” section shows the aggregated resources in a research object where the user is enabled to browse and navigate through the resources. The resources can also include folders and subfolders. When the user selects a resource, its metadata information (e.g. name, description, creation date and time, modification date and time, creators’ name etc.) is displayed at the end of the page along with the annotations added in the ROHub platform for that particular resource. From the Content page the user can also create new resources or edit/modify resources and aggregate them to the RO.

## Content home
The main section lists the RO contents in a tabular format with the name of the content, details (e.g. denoting number of entries in a folder), creation time and date and creator’s name. Additional to the drag and drop functionality, from this page the user can also add additional resources to the RO using the three on-screen functionalities (described in the later section).The home page of the content section also has a drag and drop segment for directly adding resources to the RO.

## Creating new resources
From the content page the user can create new resources from the  create icons present at the top of the resources list. There are three functionalities added to the ROHUb portal for creating folders and adding/uploading files as resources in the RO content.  
### Create new folder
On clicking the “Create new folder” icon an new window pops up for the user. Here the user can create a new folder by typing the title, description and can also choose the parent folder from the dropped down list of the existing folders in the RO content if the user wants to enlist it in any of them.  Otherwise simply keeping this field empty will create a new folder in the home of the content section. On clicking the “Create” the user creates a new folder which will be visible in the content list of the RO. The figure below shows the creation of the folder in the RO content page.

### Create new resource from internal source
On clicking the second icon  a window pops up to “Create new resource”. The user can upload a file from his local device on clicking the “Choose file” and selecting a file/resource internally. Upon filling the “Title” and “description” fields the user has to select a “Resource type” from the list of type displayed on clicking the field of resource type to denote the type of the uploaded resource.
