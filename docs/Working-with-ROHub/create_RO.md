## Create Research Object
Once the user is logged in to the ROHUB platform he is ready to create his own research objects. In order to create a new research object the user has to fill a wizard consisting of various information vital to creation of a RO. First from the landing page of the portal the user needs to click “My ROS”, a new page opens where the user can his previously created ROs and the editable ROs he has permission to in two sections named “My RO” and “Editable RO” respectively. If the user doesn't have any previously created ROs then the page will display “There are no Research objects created by You yet.”

On the right hand side of this page there is a red button “Create new RO”. Once the user clicks a new page called “Create new Research Object” opens. This page holds the RO create wizard having various segments which are discussed separately in this document. The segments of the wizard are as follows:
* Basic information: From this segment the user can provide the compulsory information regarding creation of a RO such as title, description, RO type, research areas, RO creator and editor etc.
* People & organizations: In this segment the user can select people and organizations associated with a RO and assign roles to them. Users can also add new people & organizations in case they are not in the existing lists of the ROHUB portal.
* Tags:This segment allows the user to add keywords and research communities to a RO and also allows the user to attach the RO as a golden example in the ROHUB homepage.
* Sketches gallery: From this segment the user can upload images as sketches to a RO. The upload can be done internally from the user's computer or externally using URL.
* Resources: This segment allows the user to upload resources similarly like the sketch.
* Related locations:  Depending on the RO the user can add relevant locations to a RO from this segment.
* License & Funding: From this segment the user can select or add information regarding the license of the research contents and also can add information regarding funding of the research.
* Advanced metadata: This segment is meant for advanced users where they can add extra semantic annotations to a RO.

The first and the most important segment of the wizard is called the “Basic Information” holding fields like title, description, access mode etc. for the user to fill and create the basic structure of a new Research Object. The user can click on “Reset form” present at the bottom of the form to reset the information in the basin information form. Once the user fills up the basic information he can click on “Create & Exit” to create the RO with only the basic information and exit the wizard or click on “Create & Continue” to continue enriching the RO metadata by navigating over the next segments of the RO create wizard. Initially the basic information is sufficient to create a RO and the user can always navigate to the created RO and edit/modify the metadata later on present on the later segments of the wizard.
