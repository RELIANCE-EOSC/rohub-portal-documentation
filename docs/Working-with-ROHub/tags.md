## Tags
This segment of the RO create/edit wizard allows the user to add additional metadata to the RO such as:

### Add Keywords
In order to add a keyword to the RO, the user clicks inside the box under the “Keywords” saying “Type to add” a list of existing keywords drops down. The user can select one or multiple keywords from the list. In case of new keywords which in any case are not present in the existing list of keywords, a create option appears once the user types in the new keyword allowing the user to create a new keyword. The user can create multiple new keywords and later add them to the RO from the list. The user can also remove any of the keywords from this box.

 Secondly the user can add what's the main entity of the RO (e.g.CLI, dataset, document etc.). The user can select the most suitable entity for the RO depending on its type of contents and the main idea of the RO. In case the user wants to make the RO appear in the homepage of the ROHub portal in the golden examples, he can turn on the  “Golden” option in this segment. From “Community” the user can select the communities directly or indirectly associated with the RO. The user can continue creating/editing the metadata of the RO in the next form by clicking "Update and continue", or "Skip" to skip this part and move to the next segment or "Back" to move to the previous segment of the RO editing.
