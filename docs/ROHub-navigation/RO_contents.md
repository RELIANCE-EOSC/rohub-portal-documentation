The “Content” section shows the aggregated resources in a research object where the user is enabled to browse and navigate through the resources. The resources can also include folders and subfolders. When the user selects a resource, its metadata information (e.g. name, description, creation date and time, modification date and time, creators’ name etc.) is displayed at the end of the page along with the annotations added in the ROHub platform for that particular resource. From the Content page the user can also create new resources or edit/modify resources and aggregate them to the RO.

## Content home
The main section lists the RO contents in a tabular format with the name of the content, details (e.g. denoting number of entries in a folder), creation time and date and creator’s name. Additional to the drag and drop functionality, from this page the user can also add additional resources to the RO using the three on-screen functionalities (described in the later section).The home page of the content section also has a drag and drop segment for directly adding resources to the RO. Additionally from this page the user has the possibility to navigate through the resources in the RO content.

## Creating new resources
From the content page the user can create new resources from the  create icons present at the top of the resources list. There are three functionalities added to the ROHUb portal for creating folders and adding/uploading files as resources in the RO content.  
### Create new folder
On clicking the “Create new folder” icon an new window pops up for the user. Here the user can create a new folder by typing the title, description and can also choose the parent folder from the dropped down list of the existing folders in the RO content if the user wants to enlist it in any of them.  Otherwise simply keeping this field empty will create a new folder in the home of the content section. On clicking the “Create” the user creates a new folder which will be visible in the content list of the RO. The figure below shows the creation of the folder in the RO content page.

### Create new resource from internal source
On clicking the second icon  a window pops up to “Create new resource”. The user can upload a file from his local device on clicking the “Choose file” and selecting a file/resource internally. Upon filling the “Title” and “description” fields the user has to select a “Resource type” from the list of type displayed on clicking the field of resource type to denote the type of the uploaded resource. On clicking “Create”  the resource is added in the RO content.

### Create new resource from external source
On clicking the third icon another window pops up to “Create new resource”. The user can provide the URL of an external resource in the field saying “External URL”. Upon filling the “Title” and “description” fields the user has to select a “Resource type” from the list of type displayed on clicking the field of resource type to denote the type of the  resource. On clicking “Create” the resource is added in the RO content.

## Modifying existing resources
The user can modify or edit any resource of choice from the RO content list. The resource edit, move and delete functionalities activate when the user selects any resource from the list. Moreover on selecting a resource its metadata is also displayed as mentioned in the content home section.

### Renaming a resource
In case the selected resource is a folder the user can rename it from the “Rename folder” window that pops up when the user clicks on the edit icon present in the main content page. From this window the user can rename the title and description of the folder. Similarly for renaming internal or external resources, the user has to select the particular resource and on clicking the edit mode the “Rename resource” window appears. In this window the user can update the fields relevant to the resource type. In both cases clicking “Rename” will update the resources. The following figures depicts the renaming functionality of the RO resources.

### Moving a resource
The user can move a resource from one folder to another in the portal. The user has to select a resource from the content list and then click the move icon, a window pops up displaying either “Move folder” (for moving a folder) or “Move resource” (for moving a resource) where the user can specify the “parent folder”. Once the user clicks on the field saying parent folder, a list of all the existing folders of the content appears. From the list the user can easily specify the folder where he wants to move the resource. Clicking “Move” ends the action and moves the resource from one folder to another.
