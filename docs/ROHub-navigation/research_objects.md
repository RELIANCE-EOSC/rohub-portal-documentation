The ROHub users can access a research object either by the keyword search or from the "Explore" section. From the list of ROs in the explore page the user can access any specific RO and its subsequent metadata on clicking “Read more” on the right hand side of the adjacent RO. The metadata of a specific research object in the ROHub platform can be categorised in various subsections as described below.

## Overview
The overview subsection of the Research Object displays the essential information/metadata of the RO. It consists the following components:
* The main metadata includes the title, description, research areas, research object type, creation mode, creation date, last modification date, creator’s identity and relevant sketch associated with the research object.
* Some especially relevant metadata elements might include the geospatial information associated with the research object that can be displayed in a map popup window, and the annotations added automatically by the semantic enrichment service.
* The overview page also gives a summary of the contents encapsulated within the research object inspite of having a separate section for contents in the research object. The content subsection within the overview page shows the relevant contents and enables the user to navigate through them.
* Within the overview page the Activity subsection summarizes the recent activity done on the research object. The user will be transferred to the main activity page within the research object on clicking the “View all” option.
* The overview also contains the Lifecycle chart subsection where the evolution of the research object can be summarised for the user. From this subsection the user can navigate to the main lifecycle page of the research object on clicking “View all”.
* The overview also contains the annotations added automatically to the research object by the semantic enrichment service. Selecting “Show All Annotations” at the end of the overview panel, drops down all the annotations added to the research object. Each annotation pops out in a separate window on clicking one of the annotations listed within the list. The user can also hide the annotation list on clicking the “Hide Annotations”.
* On the right side of the overview page contains the various toolbars such as:
   * Summary of the RO including the number of views, downloads, resources, annotations, activity events, forks, snapshots/archives, as well as the RO quality score, and the research object size.
   * “AGENTS” subsection holds the usernames of the creator and the importer associated with the RO.
   * “QUALITY” shows the status of the quality of the RO in regard of its completeness.
   * “KEYWORDS” subsection holds the relevant keywords associated with the RO
   * “TOOLBOX” section allowing the user to download the research object, or its metadata; to get the research object atom feed that can be used to subscribe to the research object notifications; manage the research object evolution if the user is allowed (e.g., to create snapshots, archives, or fork the research object); manage the research object annotations if the user is allowed (e.g., to update the annotations from the semantic enrichment service, import an annotation body, or display the advanced annotation view
   * “SHARE” allows the user to share the RO over social media or by directly creating shareable link (function still not available)
   * “Cite As” subsection shows the citations used in the RO (if any)
   * “LICENSE” subsection shows the associated license of the RO (if any) and the contents enclosed with the RO.
   * “GRANTS” subsection allows the user to see the funsing body supporting the research.
