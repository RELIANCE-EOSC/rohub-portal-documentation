## Text Mining and Enrichment Services

IN ROHub the text mining and enrichment services include production-ready services and extended analytic services.  This service refers to an enrichment service which includes a search service and a recommendation service. ROHub is fully integrated with the latest release of the enrichment service, and thus its functionality is   available   both from   the   ROHub   portal   and the Python   library. The   service   is  executed automatically  by  ROHub  for  new/updated  Research  Objects  at  certain  periods  of  time  (every  few hours by default), but the user can force the (re-)execution of the service on demand. From ROHub portal, the user is able to execute the service on demand and visualize the annotations generated   from   the   Research   Object   overview   tab.   The   enrichment   component   shows   the annotations  in  different  color  depending  on  the  type  of  annotation,  as  depicted  in the figure below.  To call  the  service  on  demand,  the  user  needs  to  be  logged  in  and  have  write  permissions  over  the Research  Object,  and  then  the user  needs  to  click  on  the  refresh  icon  at  the  right  top  corner  of  this component as shown in the figure below.
