# Delete a Research Object
A user can delete a Research Object created by him or if having edit permissions. In order to delete a RO the user has to navigate to the list of ROs in the “MY RO” or “Editable ROs” section of the ROHUB. There is a “Delete” option for each of the ROs that prompts a window  called “Research object deleting”. On clicking the “YES” the user can successfully delete the RO from the ROHUB. Upon deletion the RO gets removed from the Explore page and also from the My ROS section. The figure below shows the deleting process of a RO.
