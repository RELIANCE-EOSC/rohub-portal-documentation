Once logged in and authenticated in the ROHub portal, the user can create a research object on clicking the “Create new RO” from the “My ROs” page. The user is navigated to various forms and can provide the necessary information as metadata of the research object he wants to create. The following subsections describe the various parts of the “Create new Research Object” form in the process of creating a new research object.

## Basic Information
The first form in creation of a RO is “Basic information” that allows the user to add the key information of a RO in such as:
* Title: In this field the user provides the title of the created Research Object. This is a required field and must be filled.
* Description: The description box allows the user to type in the description of a RO. It's compulsory for a user to fill the description of a RO.
* Access mode: The user has to choose from the given access modes “Public”, “Private” or “Open” to specify the access mode of a RO.
* Editor: In this field the user can give the name of the editors from the list of the existing users of the ROHub portal. The user can start typing to find the name of the user from the drop down list.  By clicking the “x” icon present at the end of this field the user can reset the whole field and remove all the entered values.
* Owner: In this field the name of the user creating the RO is given as the owner of the RO. By default the name of the logged in user is present here as the owner of the RO. If the user wants to modify or change the owner he can simply start to type and choose anyone else from the list of the existing users.
* Research areas: From this field the user can provide the names of the research areas designated to the RO. On clicking this field drops down the whole list of existing research areas present in the ROhub portal. The user can select one or multiple research areas from this list suitable to the RO. If the user wants to remove any of the provided entries he can remove it by clicking the small “x” alongside each entry. By clicking the “x” icon present at the end of this field the user can reset the whole field and remove all the entered values.
* Research object type: From this field the user can denote the type of the RO. By default the RO holds “Basic Research Object” in this field. The user can change it if required by clicking the field and selecting any one of the types of RO from the drop down list.
Filling the basic information is sufficient to create a RO in the ROHub platform, but the user can continue enriching the RO with other metadata or simply create the basic RO and exit by clicking "Create and Exit" . On clicking “Create and Continue '' present at the bottom right of this page the user can create the RO and also simultaneously navigate through other forms to add the various relevant metadata in order to enrich the research object. The user can always come back again later to edit the metadata of the newly created RO listed in the My ROs section. "Reset form" allows the user to reset the basic information form and provide inputs again. Once the RO is created with the basic information the newly created RO can be accessed from the Explore page of the ROHub also. The user can continue to add additional metadata during the creation process or edit the RO later by clicking the edit option from the RO toolbox. The below mentioned sections are the additional metadata the user can add to enrich a RO.

The same step can be repeated in order to add another user and to assign roles. The added user and the role can be removed on clicking the “x” alongside the name of the user. Removing one user also removes his role/s.
### Add existing organizations from list

The user can continue creating/editing the metadata of the RO in the next form by clicking "Update and continue", or "Skip" to skip this part and move to the next segment or "Back" to move to the previous segment of the RO creation.


## Resources
From the content page the user can create new resources from the  create icons present at the top of the resources list. There are three functionalities added to the ROHUb portal for creating folders and adding/uploading files as resources in the RO content.

### Create new folder
On clicking the “Create new folder” icon an new window pops up for the user. Here the user can create a new folder by typing the title, description and can also choose the parent folder from the dropped down list of the existing folders in the RO content if the user wants to enlist it in any of them.  Otherwise simply keeping this field empty will create a new folder in the home of the content section. On clicking the “Create” the user creates a new folder which will be visible in the content list of the RO. The figure below shows the creation of the folder in the RO content page.

<p align="center"> <img src="https://box.psnc.pl/f/14dc1db3dd/?raw=1" width="500"> </p>
<div align="center"> Figure 2: Creating new folder in ROHub </div>

### Create new resource from internal source
On clicking the second icon  a window pops up to “Create new resource”. The user can upload a file from his local device on clicking the “Choose file” and selecting a file/resource internally. Upon filling the “Title” and “description” fields the user has to select a “Resource type” from the list of type displayed on clicking the field of resource type to denote the type of the uploaded resource. On clicking “Create”  the resource is added in the RO content. Another way to create new resources is to add selected files directly by draggind and dropping in the upload segment saying "Drag and drop files here..." and providing the title, description and the resource type.

<div align="center"> Figure 3: Creating new internal resource in ROHub </div>

### Create new resource from external source
On clicking the third icon another window pops up to “Create new resource”. The user can provide the URL of an external resource in the field saying “External URL”. Upon filling the “Title” and “description” fields the user has to select a “Resource type” from the list of type displayed on clicking the field of "Resource type" to denote the type of the  resource. On clicking “Create” the resource is added in the RO content.

<div align="center"> Figure 3: Creating new internal resource in ROHub </div>

The user can modify or edit any resource of choice from the resource list. The resource edit, move and delete functionalities activate when the user selects any resource from the list. Moreover on selecting a resource its metadata is also displayed as mentioned in the content home section.

### Renaming a resource
In case the selected resource is a folder the user can rename it from the “Rename folder” window that pops up when the user clicks on the edit icon present in the main content page. From this window the user can rename the title and description of the folder. Similarly for renaming internal or external resources, the user has to select the particular resource and on clicking the edit mode the “Rename resource” window appears. In this window the user can update the fields relevant to the resource type. In both cases clicking “Rename” will update the resources. The following figures depicts the renaming functionality of the RO resources.

### Moving a resource
The user can move a resource from one folder to another in the portal. The user has to select a resource from the content list and then click the move icon, a window pops up displaying either “Move folder” (for moving a folder) or “Move resource” (for moving a resource) where the user can specify the “parent folder”. Once the user clicks on the field saying parent folder, a list of all the existing folders of the content appears. From the list the user can easily specify the folder where he wants to move the resource. Clicking “Move” ends the action and moves the resource from one folder to another.

<div align="center"> Figure 8: Deleting a resource in ROHub portal </div>

### Adding Annotation to a resource
Once a resource is created the annotation of the resource is also created in the content section. After selecting the resource the user can also see the added annotation associated with the resource by clicking the “Show All Annotations”. An advanced user can also create additional annotations to a resource by providing the semantic property and value in the boxes saying “Type property..” and “Type value..”. The property should be a fully qualified name (URL), otherwise the ROHub namespace will be prepended, whereas the value can be of any type (e.g. URL, text, numeric). Thereafter clicking “Add” will add the annotation with the selected resource and will be visible in the annotation list. On clicking any of the annotations from the list the user can see the annotation metadata like the annotation id, subject, property and value.
