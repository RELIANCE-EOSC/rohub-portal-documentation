The ROHub users can access a research object either by the keyword search or from the "Explore" section. From the list of ROs in the explore page the user can access any specific RO and its subsequent metadata on clicking “Read more” on the right hand side of the adjacent RO. The metadata of a specific research object in the ROHub platform can be categorized in various subsections as described below.

## Overview
The overview subsection of the Research Object displays the essential information/metadata of the RO. It consists the following components:
* The main metadata component at the top includes the title of the RO, description, research areas, research object type, access mode, status,  creation date and time, last modification date and time, last activity date and time, creator’s identity and the relevant sketch associated with the research object.
* In some especially relevant ROs the metadata elements might include geospatial information associated with the RO that can be displayed in a map popup window. The segment for geolocation displays the geographic information as the user clicks the “Location” segment.  In this case the annotations for the geolocation are added automatically by the semantic enrichment service.
* The overview page also shows a summary of the contents encapsulated within the research object inspite of having a separate section for contents in the research object. The content subsection within the overview page shows the aggregated resources/contents of the RO and enables the user to browse through them.
* Within the overview page the Activity segment summarizes the most recent activity done on the research object. The user will be transferred to the main activity section to see all the available activities of the research object on clicking the “View all” option.
* The overview also contains the Lifecycle segment where the most recent evolution of the research object is summarized for the user with information of the user and date and time of the activity. From this subsection the user can navigate to the main lifecycle section of the research object to see all the overall evolution of the RO on clicking “View all”.
* The overview also contains the annotations added automatically to the research object by the semantic enrichment service. Selecting “Show All Annotations” at the end of the overview panel, drops down and displays all the annotations added to the research object. Each annotation pops out in a separate window on clicking one of the annotations listed within the list. The user can also hide the annotation list on clicking the “Hide Annotations”.
* On the right side of the overview page contains the various segments and toolbars such as:
   * Summary segment of the RO including rating, comment, likes, the number of views and downloads. Additional quantitative metadata such as the number of resources, annotations, activity events, forks, snapshots/archives, as well as the research object size can be displayed on clicking “See more details” present in this segment.
   * “AGENTS” segment holds the name of the creator and the importer associated with the Research Object. The user can click on the name of the creator and navigate to the user profile from this segment.
   * “QUALITY” shows the status of the quality of the RO in regard to its percentage of completeness. This is a status bar which shows the percentage of the RO quality.
   * “DISCOVERED METADATA” segment holds the relevant metadata/keywords suitable with the RO for the purpose of better keyword-based search of the ROs. There is a legend having different colors for denoting keywords relating to “Persons”, “Domains”, “Frequent Expressions”, “Places”, “Organizations” and “Concepts”.
   * “TOOLBOX” segment allowing the user to download the research object, or its metadata; to get the research object atom feed that can be used to subscribe to the research object notifications; manage the research object evolution if the user is allowed (e.g., to create snapshots, archives, or fork the research object); manage the research object annotations if the user is allowed (e.g., to update the annotations from the semantic enrichment service, import an annotation body, or display the advanced annotation view
   * “SHARE” allows the user to share the RO over social media e.g. Twitter, Facebook etc (still under integration) or by directly creating and copying shareable link.
   * “Cite As” segment shows the citations used in the RO (if any)
   * “LICENSE” segment shows the associated license of the RO (if any). The user can view the license by directly clicking on it. On clicking the user will be redirected to the webpage describing the license.
   * “GRANTS” segment allows the user to see the funding body supporting the research. A clickable link will redirect the user to directly access more information of the funding body/organization from its official webpage.
* At the very end of the overview page lies the comment section where the user can provide their comments and post them.

## Content
This section shows the aggregated resources in a research object where the user is enabled to browse and navigate through the resources. The resources can also include folders and subfolders. When the user selects a resource, its metadata information is displayed at the end of the page along with the annotations added in the ROHub platform for that particular resource. The Content page of a research object comprise of the following sections:
* The navigation section lists the RO contents that shows  metadata like the size or number of resources in a folder, creation time and date, creator identity etc. This page also allows the user to add resources manually or either uploading the resources by directly draging and droping in the webpage or choosing files locally from the user's desktop. The user can create a folder within a parent folder, add resouces from external links or can upload them directly in the portal from this section.
* The resource details section, which appears after the user selects (or clicks on) a resource in the navigation panel. It shows basic resource metadata e.g. title, resource type, number of contents in case of folder, URI (in case of a single resource element), creation date, modification date, author etc. Moreover on selecting a resource the content section shows actions on these resources from where the user is allowed certain actions like moving the content across various folders, edition, deletion etc.
* On selecting a single resource the user is allowed to see the available annotation list associated with the resource.  On clicking the “Show Annotations” the user can see the annotations associated with that particular resource selected by the user.
