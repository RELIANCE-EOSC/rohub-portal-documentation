Once logged in and authenticated in the ROHub portal, the user can create a research object on clicking the “Create new RO” from the “My ROs” page. The user is navigated to a form and can provide the necessary information as metadata of the research object he wants to create. The following subsections describe the various parts of the “Create new Research Object” form in the process of creating a new research object.

## Basic Information
The first form in creation of a RO is “Basic information” that allows the user to add the key information of a RO in such as:
* Title: In this field the user provides the title of the created Research Object. This is a required field and must be filled.
* Description: The description box allows the user to type in the description of a RO. It's compulsory for a user to fill the description of a RO.
* Access mode: The user has to choose from the given access modes “Public”, “Private” or “Open” to specify the access mode of a RO.
* Editor: In this field the user can give the name of the editors from the list of the existing users of the ROHub portal. The user can start typing to find the name of the user from the drop down list.  By clicking the “x” icon present at the end of this field the user can reset the whole field and remove all the entered values.
* Owner: In this field the name of the user creating the RO is given as the owner of the RO. By default the name of the logged in user is present here as the owner of the RO. If the user wants to modify or change the owner he can simply start to type and choose anyone else from the list of the existing users.
* Research areas: From this field the user can provide the names of the research areas designated to the RO. On clicking this field drops down the whole list of existing research areas present in the ROhub portal. The user can select one or multiple research areas from this list suitable to the RO. If the user wants to remove any of the provided entries he can remove it by clicking the small “x” alongside each entry. By clicking the “x” icon present at the end of this field the user can reset the whole field and remove all the entered values.
* Research object type: From this field the user can denote the type of the RO. By default the RO holds “Basic Research Object” in this field. The user can change it if required by clicking the field and selecting any one of the types of RO from the drop down list.
Filling the basic information is sufficient to create a RO in the ROHub platform, but the user can continue enriching the RO with other metadata or simply create the basic RO and exit by clicking "Create and Exit" . On clicking “Create and Continue” preset at the bottom right of this page the user can create the RO and also simultaneously navigate through other forms to add the various relevant metadata in order to enrich the research object. The user can always come back again later to modify the metadata of the newly created RO listed in the My ROs section. "Reset form" allows the user to reset the basic information form and provide inputs again.

## People & organizations
On clicking the "Create and Continue" in the RO creation page the user moves from the basic information form to a new form. This form allows the user to provide information about the people and organization associated with the research object. The functionalities can be discussed as below:
### Add existing user from list
In order to add an existing user to the RO, i user needs to select the option “Add existing user from list” and on clicking or simply starting to type in the search box reading “Start typing to find user”. The list of the existing users drops down and a user can be selected from the list. Once an user is selected another box appears alongside on the right side where the role of the selected user can be designated. The list of the roles (e.g. Author, Contributor, publisher or Copyright holder) drops down in a list once the user clicks on the second box. Multiple roles can be assigned for a single user. The same step can be repeated in order to add another user and to assign roles. The added user and the role can be removed on clicking the “x” alongside the name of the user. Removing one user also removes his role/s.
