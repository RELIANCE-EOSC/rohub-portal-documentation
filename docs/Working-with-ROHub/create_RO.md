Once the user is logged in to the ROHUB platform he is ready to create his own research objects. In order to create a new research object the user has to fill a wizard consisting of various information vital to creation of a RO. First from the landing page of the portal the user needs to click “My ROS”, a new page opens where the user can his previously created ROs and the editable ROs he has permission to in two sections named “My RO” and “Editable RO” respectively. If the user doesn't have any previously created ROs then the page will display “There are no Research objects created by You yet.”

On the right hand side of this page there is a red button “Create new RO”. Once the user clicks a new page called “Create new Research Object” opens. This page holds the RO create wizard having various segments. The first and the most important segment of the wizard is called the “Basic Information” holding fields like title, description, access mode etc. for the user to fill and create the basic structure of a new RO. The user can click on “Reset form” present at the bottom of the form to reset the information in the basin information form. Once the user fills up the basic information he can click on “Create & Exit” to create the RO with only the basic information and exit the wizard or click on “Create & Continue” to continue enriching the RO metadata by navigating over the next segments of the RO create wizard.
