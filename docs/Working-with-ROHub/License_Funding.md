## License & Funding
### Selection and creation of licenses
In this segment the user can choose the details about the funding body and the common licenses that can be used for the intellectual properties of the contents of the RO. There are few well known and commonly used “Creative Common Attribution” licenses that the user can select. Otherwise the user can select the “Other” option and choose a license from the list of licenses. In case of no license or removal of a preselect license the user can select the “None” option. The user can also use the “Create my own license” option to provide the information about a license in case it's not available in any of the predefined licenses in the ROHUB portal. The user need to provide the license identifier, title, description and the URL and also need to mention the status of the license (e.g. Active, Retired). On clicking “Add license” the user can add the license he has just created to the RO.

### Creating grant and funding body
There is a form in this segment allowing the user to provide information regarding  the Grant and the funding body. The user can provide the grant identifier, grant name, title of the grant, DOI of the funder and the name of the funding body.  Thereafter clicking “Add funding” adds the information of funds to the RO.
The user can continue creating/editing and save the metadata of the RO by clicking "Update and continue", or "Skip" to skip this part and move to the next segment or "Back" to move to the previous segment of the RO editing.
