# Evolution Wizard
Any Research Object can be forked, snapshotted or archived from the Evolution wizard. In the toolbox segment present on the right hand side of the overview page of a RO a user can find the “Evolution”. On clicking the “Evolution” the user can see the “Fork”, “Snapshot” and “Archive” options. Each of them are briefly discussed in the sections below. The figure below shows how to navigate to the “Evolution” wizard from the overview page of a RO.
