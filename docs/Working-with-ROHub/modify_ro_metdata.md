Once the RO is created with the basic information the newly created RO can be accessed from the Explore page of the ROHub or from the "My Ro" sections also. The user can continue to add additional metadata during the creation process or edit the RO later by clicking the edit option from the RO toolbox from the RO Overview page. The edit option of the RO opens the "Research Object editting" page containing the various elements of RO creation. While modifying the RO the below mentioned sections are the additional metadata the user can add to enrich a basic RO.
## People & organizations
This form allows the user to provide information about the people and organization associated with the research object. The functionalities can be discussed as below:
### Add existing user from list
In order to add an existing user to the RO, i user needs to select the option “Add existing user from list” and on clicking or simply starting to type in the search box reading “Start typing to find user”. The list of the existing users drops down and a user can be selected from the list. Once an user is selected another box appears alongside on the right side where the role of the selected user can be designated. The list of the roles (e.g. Author, Contributor, publisher or Copyright holder) drops down in a list once the user clicks on the second box. Multiple roles can be assigned for a single user. The same step can be repeated in order to add another user and to assign roles. The added user and the role can be removed on clicking the “x” alongside the name of the user. Removing one user also removes his role/s.
### Add existing organizations from list
The process of adding an existing organization to a RO is similar to adding an existing member. The user has to select the “Add existing organization from list” option. From the search box the drop down list containing all the existing organization the user can select any one of them and assign a role (e.g. Publisher, Copyright Holder) to the selected organization. The same step can be repeated in order to add another organization and to assign roles to it. The added organization and the role can be removed on clicking the “x” alongside the name of the user. Removing one organization also removes its role/s.

## Tags
This section allows the user to add additional metadata to the RO. In order to add a keyword the user clicks inside the box under the “Keywords” saying “Type to add” a list of existing keywords drops down. The user can select one or multiple keywords from the list. In case of new keywords which in any case are not present in the existing list of keywords, a create option appears allowing the user to create a new keyword. The user can create multiple new keywords and later add them to the RO from the list. Secondly the user can add what's the main entity of the RO (e.g.CLI, dataset, document etc.). The user can select the most suitable entity for the RO depending on its type of contents and the main idea of the RO. In case the user wants to make the RO appear in the homepage of the ROHub portal in the golden examples, he can turn on the  “Golden” option in this segment. From “Community” the user can select the communities directly or indirectly associated with the RO. The user can continue creating/editing the metadata of the RO in the next form by clicking "Update and continue", or "Skip" to skip this part and move to the next segment or "Back" to move to the previous segment of the RO editing.

The user can continue creating/editing the metadata of the RO in the next form by clicking "Update and continue", or "Skip" to skip this part and move to the next segment or "Back" to move to the previous segment of the RO editing.


## Resources
From the content page the user can create new resources from the  create icons present at the top of the resources list. There are three functionalities added to the ROHUb portal for creating folders and adding/uploading files as resources in the RO content.

### Create new folder
On clicking the “Create new folder” icon an new window pops up for the user. Here the user can create a new folder by typing the title, description and can also choose the parent folder from the dropped down list of the existing folders in the RO content if the user wants to enlist it in any of them.  Otherwise simply keeping this field empty will create a new folder in the home of the content section. On clicking the “Create” the user creates a new folder which will be visible in the content list of the RO. The figure below shows the creation of the folder in the RO content page.

<p align="center"> <img src="https://box.psnc.pl/f/14dc1db3dd/?raw=1" width="500"> </p>
<div align="center"> Figure 7: Creating new folder in ROHub </div>

### Create new resource from internal source
On clicking the second icon  a window pops up to “Create new resource”. The user can upload a file from his local device on clicking the “Choose file” and selecting a file/resource internally. Upon filling the “Title” and “description” fields the user has to select a “Resource type” from the list of type displayed on clicking the field of resource type to denote the type of the uploaded resource. On clicking “Create”  the resource is added in the RO content. Another way to create new resources is to add selected files directly by draggind and dropping in the upload segment saying "Drag and drop files here..." and providing the title, description and the resource type.

<div align="center"> Figure 8: Creating new internal resource in ROHub </div>

### Create new resource from external source
On clicking the third icon another window pops up to “Create new resource”. The user can provide the URL of an external resource in the field saying “External URL”. Upon filling the “Title” and “description” fields the user has to select a “Resource type” from the list of type displayed on clicking the field of "Resource type" to denote the type of the  resource. On clicking “Create” the resource is added in the RO content.

<div align="center"> Figure 9: Creating new internal resource in ROHub </div>

The user can modify or edit any resource of choice from the resource list. The resource edit, move and delete functionalities activate when the user selects any resource from the list. Moreover on selecting a resource its metadata is also displayed as mentioned in the content home section.

### Renaming a resource
In case the selected resource is a folder the user can rename it from the “Rename folder” window that pops up when the user clicks on the edit icon present in the main content page. From this window the user can rename the title and description of the folder. Similarly for renaming internal or external resources, the user has to select the particular resource and on clicking the edit mode the “Rename resource” window appears. In this window the user can update the fields relevant to the resource type. In both cases clicking “Rename” will update the resources. The following figures depicts the renaming functionality of the RO resources.

<div align="center"> Figure 11: Renaming a resource in ROHub portal </div>


### Moving a resource
The user can move a resource from one folder to another in the portal. The user has to select a resource from the content list and then click the move icon, a window pops up displaying either “Move folder” (for moving a folder) or “Move resource” (for moving a resource) where the user can specify the “parent folder”. Once the user clicks on the field saying parent folder, a list of all the existing folders of the content appears. From the list the user can easily specify the folder where he wants to move the resource. Clicking “Move” ends the action and moves the resource from one folder to another.

<div align="center"> Figure 15: Deleting a resource in ROHub portal </div>

### Adding annotation to a resource
Once a resource is created the annotation of the resource is also created in the content section. After selecting the resource the user can also see the added annotation associated with the resource by clicking the “Show All Annotations”. An advanced user can also create additional annotations to a resource by providing the semantic property and value in the boxes saying “Type property..” and “Type value..”. The property should be a fully qualified name (URL), otherwise the ROHub namespace will be prepended, whereas the value can be of any type (e.g. URL, text, numeric). Thereafter clicking “Add” will add the annotation with the selected resource and will be visible in the annotation list. On clicking any of the annotations from the list the user can see the annotation metadata like the annotation id, subject, property and value.

<div align="center"> Figure 16: Adding an annotation to a resource in ROHub portal </div>

The user can continue creating/editing the metadata of the RO in the next form by clicking "Update and continue", or "Skip" to skip this part and move to the next segment or "Back" to move to the previous segment of the RO editing.

## Related locations
From this segment the user can add geolocation to any relevant RO. Clicking the icon of  “Add location” a new window with a map layer opens up. In the map layer on the top left side there are zooming and un-zooming options, the center of the maplayer by default shows a point on Poznan, on the right hand side there are various functional icons to draw geometry on the map layer and also functionalities to edit/delete geometry layers.

<div align="center"> Figure 17: Locations of an RO in ROHub portal </div>

### Adding new location
The various function to add geometry to the map layer are as follows:
* “Draw a polygon”: Once the user clicks on the polygon shaped icon on the map layer a marker appears saying “Click to start drawing shape” guiding the user to draw a shape on the map layer. The user clicks on the desired location and a point appears on the map layer and the pointer says “Click to continue drawing shape”. The user can add as many points as he wants until coming back to the first point to enclose an area. On the final click the guide pointer says “Click first point to close this shape”. The user can also see options to “finish”, “Delete last point” or “Cancel” while drawing a polygon. Once the area is finished the map layer disappears and the created geometry gets added in the location of the RO.

<div align="center"> Figure 18: Adding polygon area as Location</div>

* “Draw a rectangle”: Once the user clicks on the rectangle shaped icon on the map layer a marker appears saying “Click and drag to draw rectangle” guiding the user to draw a rectangle on the map layer. The user clicks on the desired location on the map and drags and the pointer says “Release mouse to finish drawing” along with the enclosed area in hectares of the area covered within the rectangle. The user can also see options to “Cancel” while drawing a rectangle. Once the user releases the mouse the rectangle area gets finished and added to the list of locations of the RO and the map layer disappears.

### Editing and Deleting Layers
A particular RO can have a variety of locations named as Area or Point depending on the geometry. The ROHUB platform also allows the user to edit or delete the added locations. Once a user clicks on a location it opens in the map layer and the user can see options like “Edit Layers” and “Delete Layers”.
* Edit Layers: Once the user opens a location in the map layer the edit layers function allows the user to edit the location or area of the geometry. While editing a location the pointer guides the user displaying “Drag handles or markers to edit features”. On completion the user can save or cancel the changes by clicking “Save” or “Cancel”.

The user can continue creating/editing the metadata of the RO in the next form by clicking "Update and continue", or "Skip" to skip this part and move to the next segment or "Back" to move to the previous segment of the RO editing.

## License & Funding
### Selection and creation of licenses
In this segment the user can choose the details about the funding body and the common licenses that can be used for the intellectual properties of the contents of the RO. There are few well known and commonly used “Creative Common Attribution” licenses that the user can select. Otherwise the user can select the “Other” option and choose a license from the list of licenses. In case of no license or removal of a preselect license the user can select the “None” option. The user can also use the “Create my own license” option to provide the information about a license in case it's not available in any of the predefined licenses in the ROHUB portal. The user need to provide the license identifier, title, description and the URL and also need to mention the status of the license (e.g. Active, Retired). On clicking “Add license” the user can add the license he has just created to the RO.

### Creating grant and funding body
There is a form in this segment allowing the user to provide information regarding  the Grant and the funding body. The user can provide the grant identifier, grant name, title of the grant, DOI of the funder and the name of the funding body.  Thereafter clicking “Add funding” adds the information of funds to the RO.
The user can continue creating/editing and save the metadata of the RO by clicking "Update and continue", or "Skip" to skip this part and move to the next segment or "Back" to move to the previous segment of the RO editing.
