The Explore page can be accessed by the user on clicking “EXPLORE” from the topmost menubar of the ROHub platform. This section enables the user to browse and navigate the research objects collection by organising them according to their semantic properties and allowing users to discover the objects by applying multiple search filters. By default the explore page lists all the available ROs, the user can sort them according to ascending/descending data of creation. The number of ROs in one page can be changed too from the explore page for the user as well as the user can see the total number of results. From the explore page the user can browse/search ROs in the following ways:

## Faceted search and Research Object list
In the Faceted serach section the user can search for keyword specific research objects from the keyword search box present at the top of the explore page. This fetches the list of Research Objects according to the keywords used for the search. The view is made by default in list view and another option of image icon (wherever available) for each RO is available. In both cases the same information about ROs is presented. Each research object in the list contains the key metadata like title, description, RO type, research areas, creation date and time, level of completeness, number of aggregated resources etc. as depicted in the figure below. On clicking the “View” the user can enter into the research object with its respective sections. The list is sortable on the basis of the date of creation of a RO.

## Filter search
The filter search allows the user to further filter the results of the fetched ROs and resources according to various criteria. The figures below shows the filter section for ROs and Resources present in the left side of the explore page. The user can click on either "Research objects" or "Resources" to fetch the list based on the chosen filter criterion. On clicking the green drop-down icon the user can select the options from each filter sections and also can reset all the filters from this section. There is also a "Reset filter" to reset all the filter values.

### Research Object Filter search
Each filter section has various options to choose so that the user can filter through the most desired results of the research object. The subsections and their figures are as follows:

#### Research Areas
In the filter the user can select the from a vast range of research areas (broadly in applied sciences, earth sciences, life sciences, physical sciences and space science) available in the ROhub platform to fetch the results from those specific research areas. The user can choose multiple research areas to fetch the available list of ROs based on the chosen areas as shown in the screenshot below.

<div align="center"> Figure 4: Research area filter options </div>


#### People
In this filter the user can fetch the list if ROs based on the names of the creator, owner or contributor of the ROs. On clicking the green icon of "Peopl" filter the user can either choose any of the options of "Creator", "Owner" or "Contributor" icons under this filter and start typing the name in the search box or simply by clicking and choosing the name of the ROhub user from the drop-down list. The search will return the list of the ROs based on the user's input. A screenshot is given below of the people search filter.

<div align="center"> Figure 5: Filter options for People </div>

#### Dates
From this filter the user can fetch the ROs created or modified within a time period defined by the user. Upon choosing the option of "Created" or "Modified", the user has to provide the start date in the box saying "From" and the end date in the box saying "To" and then click on "OK", the portal then shows the list of ROs created or modified on that specific date range as provided by the user. A screenshot is given below.

<div align="center"> Figure 6: Date filter </div>

#### Tags
From the Tag filter the user can fetch a list of ROs based on the associated tags of the ROs. A research object hold a variety of tags for the purpose of accesibility and discoverablity. In the list of available options in this filer search the user can type in or choose from the list of available tags in each subsections. The screenshot below shows the tag filters.

<div align="center"> Figure 7: Tag filter </div>

#### Status
This filter can be used for filtering the research objects based on their status (e.g. live, archived, forked or snapshot). By default the number of each status type is shown alongside. On clicking each type the respective RO list can be fetched by the user.

#### Rating
The "Rating" filter allows the user to select the research objects from the range of ratings. There are  five stars present and the user can select on each stars to see the ROs based on the number of stars (1-5).

#### Access mode
By using this filter the user can select the ROs published with access mode as public, private or open. Similar to the above-mentioned filter sections the number of public, private or open ROs are displayed by default.

<!--
#### Creator
The ROHub platform allows the user to filter the research objects from the platform based on the identity of the creators. The user can provide the names of single or multiple creators (from the signed up users of ROHub) to see the results of the research objects created by them. Once the user starts to type in the search field or simply click on it the list of the existing users of the ROHub portal drops down and the user can select one or multiple users from the list. There is also possibility to delete any of the entered value by clicking the "x" icon alongside the provided value.

<div align="center"> Figure 4: Filter options for RO Creator</div>With the help of this filter the user can select and filter the ROs modified on a desired date range provided by the user. The user can provide the range by selecting a date from the calendar to set a "Date from" and a “Date to” and by clicking “OK” the portal shows the list of ROs modified on that specific date range.

#### Owner

On providing the names of owner/s the user can filter the research objects based on the information provided.The user can provide the names of single or multiple RO owners (from the signed up users of ROHub) to see the results of the research objects owned by them. Once the user starts to type in the search field or simply click on it the list of the existing users of the ROHub portal drops down and the user can select one or multiple users from the list. There is also possibility to delete any of the entered value by clicking the "x" icon alongside the provided value.

#### Modificator
Similar to the owner and creator the user can filter the ROs based on the information of the users who are designated as the modificators of specific research objects. The filter procedure is same as owner and creator as mentioned above.

#### Metrics
This is the filter for selecting research objects based on the quantitative values of its metadata elements like folders, resources, annotation, aggregations as well as other portal specific elements like number of views, downloads, likes, dislikes, snapshots, forks, archives and ratings. Once the user clicks the drop down arrow alongside the “Metrics” another list opens including the number of the below-mentioned items. The number range of items for each ROs are set to be <50, 50-100 and >100. The user can choose the number of each item and fetch the RO results comprising of those metrics on clicking on each items of the Metrics as follows:
* Folders: From here the user can select the ROs with a definite number of folders.
* Resources: Using this filter the user can choose the ROs with the number of resources for his choice as per the range of items.
* All aggregates: The user can choose the number of aggregation from this filter section and get the result of ROs.
* Annotations: Fetches the ROs according to the number of annotations from this filter.
